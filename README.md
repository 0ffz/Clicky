# Clicky
A Django app that runs a site for temporary, easily creatable voting rooms. Its goal is to avoid the use of any additional devices during lessons, and be as simple to use for the host and participants as possible. 

As such, there are no labels, no prepared questions or correct answers, simply a chart and a reset button. The context is up to you to create.

You can find it [hosted on Heroku](https://clickychoice.herokuapp.com) or host it yourself. You may create a room with 2-10 choices and let any number of people join in.
